is a before and after school service, you can access one or the other or both sessions, depending on how your own day is set up, and indeed you donâ€™t have to have every day the same. <br>
Before school:<br>
includes breakfast from our standard menu, served between 7:15 & 8:10am,. It also includes transfer to school in plenty of time for an excellent start to the day. We open at 7am and will take in any time after that until 8:30am.  <br>

After school:<br>
we pick up from the school gate and will take care of your child until 6pm. <br>
Our general plan for afternoon sessions is from 3:30 to 4:30 we will be in one of our three local parks (unless the weather is truly dreadful) where we utilise a mixture of park furniture and team games, to let off steam in a safe environment. 
Then walking back to The Den, we will provide tea, from 4:45ish to 5:15ish which will contain a savoury snack, a sweet snack or equivalent and a drink from our planned menus. <br>
After which we will have child chosen activities with story time, jigsaws, quiet reading, storytelling circle, writing, art activities, any homework that they have been given, and social time with their peers. </p>
